[Brief Introduction]
I am a sophomore at the University of Detroit Mercy and am interested in cybersecurity, information systems, computer science, AI, IT auditing, and ethical hacking. 

## Objective
[My objective is to create a list of projects I have worked on and am currently working on.]

I had originally started off as a 5 Year B.S in Computer Science with M.S in Software Engineering. However, I decided to switch into the 5 Year B.S in Information Systems with M.S in Cybersecurity Management as well as a minor in Computer Science.  I am looking for positions where I can apply my
knowledge in real-world cybersecurity and information systems, while also expanding my skills. I am looking for opportunities to gain hands-on experience and collaborate with professionals.
